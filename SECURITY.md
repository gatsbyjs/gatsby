## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue with any of Gatsby's open source or commercial offerings, we would love to receive your report! Security findings can be emailed to security@gatsbyjs.com.

When reporting a security issue, describe the issue in detail and include steps to reproduce. The more detail provided, the more likely we will be able to reproduce the issue and determine a course of action.

Please do not report findings from `npm audit`. We are aware of package dependency issues that are reported by this tool and do review these reports. In many cases the issues reported by `npm audit` are misleading and do not present a tangible/exploitable security risk for Gatsby users.
