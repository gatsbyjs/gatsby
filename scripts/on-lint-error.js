  `Gatsby uses precommit hooks to run our linting and style checks. We do this
  to avoid additional hassle during pull request reviews, so please fix any linting
  problems before submitting pull request, because all PRs must pass these checks.
  
  If you're doing something temporary, you can disable this hook with:
    git commit --no-verify
  
  If you want disable this hook for all future commits:
    npm run hooks:uninstall
