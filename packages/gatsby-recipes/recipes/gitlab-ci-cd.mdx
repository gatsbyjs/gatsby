# Add Gitlab CI/CD

This recipe helps you setup Gitlab CI/CD in your Gatsby site to create a pipeline on gitlab.com

---

Adding the `.gitlab-ci.yml`

<File
  path=".gitlab-ci.yml"
  content="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/puzzledbytheweb/40028c837e1c20859b7f65bfe92879f1/raw/3ee7d97a4ab2b1e106a3c8a2f031d9a22b6222af/.gitlab-ci.yml"
/>

---

Now, every time you `git push <you-remote-gitlab-repo>` you will have your gatsby project building!
