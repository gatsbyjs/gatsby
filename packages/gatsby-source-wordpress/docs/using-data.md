## Menus

In order for menus to show up properly in your Gatsby site, you'll need to make sure they have a location set in WordPress. Menus that are not attached to a location are considered private data in WordPress.

Visit your menu edit page by navigating to `[yoursite].com/wp-admin/nav-menus.php`. Once you're there, scroll to the bottom of the page to see all available locations. Select a location and save your menu and your menu should show up in Gatsby.

If you need help registering additional locations, refer to the WordPress.org documentation on [registering menus](https://codex.wordpress.org/Navigation_Menus#Register_Menus).
