# Community & Support

Fortunately there are very strong WPGraphQL and Gatsby communities!

Check out this [GatsbyJS page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/contributing/community/) or this [WPGraphQL page](https://www.wpgraphql.com/community-and-support/) on community for more information about each community.

The WPGraphQL Slack is a great place to get help. Feel free to [open an issue in this repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/new) as well (after you've searched for a previously existing issue).

# That's all folks! :smile_cat:
