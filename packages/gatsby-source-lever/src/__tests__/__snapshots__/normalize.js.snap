It is the first and only open-source MVC framework that syncs all data via an Operational Transformation backend, using the same algorithm that powers Google Docs. DerbyJS is also uniquely optimized to render everything on the server as well as the client.

    "descriptionPlain": "Get in on the ground floor at a top startup, while solving the #1 challenge for every CEO: hiring the best talent.  We’re looking for a motivated and creative decision-maker to help us set, drive, and execute our product roadmap.  We have a product that users love; you will work closely with the founders to continue to translate the vision into the next level of product strategy.

Recruiting is a hot market, growing 12-15% y/y on its own, and applicant tracking systems like Lever are in high demand. At the same time, hiring has never been more competitive and costly, making talent solutions that improve a company’s hiring ROI incredibly valuable.

Design is one of Lever’s core competencies, and we believe that bringing well-designed user-experiences to the workplace will be the key to displacing the stale and broken status-quo of enterprise software. Built from the ground-up with user-centered design methodology and principles, Lever is the only hiring software that is mobilizing entire companies such as Netflix, Eventbrite, and Lyft to effortlessly collaborate on hiring. By designing to engage not only recruiters but also managers and other crucial stakeholders, we’re able to make hiring faster, higher-quality and more deeply embedded into a company’s core culture.

As a Product Manager, you will own product features from conception to launch.  You will excel at cross-functional collaboration and work with leadership, design, engineering, sales, marketing, and customer success to deliver value to users through product launches.  You will seamlessly flow between high-level strategic planning and day-to-day project execution. You will set and achieve ambitious goals on growth, adoption and engagement, helping the company both define and achieve its success.

We’re building a world-class product-first organization and assembling the right team to begin scaling aggressively. This is an opportunity for someone who wants to be part of something big and transformative, someone who will play a critical role in driving our success.

Reporting to our Product Marketing Director, you'll work hand-in-hand with Product, Sales and other Marketing teams to help both prospects and customers understand Lever's value proposition and differentiation. We'll need your help in developing sales-ready collateral; capturing customer case studies;  articulating Lever’s features and benefits; developing and prioritizing our personas; thinking through our segmentation; competitive tracking and intelligence; and carrying out research to inform certain product and product marketing decisions.

We’re building a world-class marketing organization and assembling the right team to begin scaling aggressively. This is an opportunity for someone who wants to be part of something big and transformative, someone who will play a critical (and broad) role in driving our success. 

From day one as a Leveroo, you'll be an active contributor to the Lever culture and in helping us fulfill our vision of supporting companies as they connect human potential to meaningful work. If this sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you!

Lever solves the #1 challenge for every company: hiring top talent. Recruiting is a hot market, growing 12-15% y/y on its own, and Applicant Tracking Systems like Lever are in high demand. We’ve already attracted an elite roster of customers including Netflix, Lyft, Foursquare, Reddit and Eventbrite, and we’re just getting started.

Lever is the only hiring software that is mobilizing the entire company to collaborate on hiring. Built on the technology that allows real-time collaboration in the Google Suite (our Co-Founder developed the technology, after all), we can support a true partnership between recruiters and managers. We’re able to make hiring faster, higher-quality, and more embedded into a company’s core culture.

We just closed our Series C, bringing our total funding to $70M, and now need to scale our sales team to keep up with demand. We’re looking for our head of sales enablement to help develop our quickly growing team of highly motivated Sales Development Representatives and Account Executives. This will be the first hire within our sales enablement org and you will partner directly with our SVP of Sales as well as Director of Sales Development. This role will allow you the space to creatively build a repeatable training playbook for onboarding new sales representatives as well as more established reps. You will own enablement and will collaborate with Lever's other departments including Product, Marketing and Customer Success to help reps be as productive and successful as possible.

Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs and Wave). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency. For a more in-depth look at OT, here's a conference talk that Nate, our CTO,  gave!
 
Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure.

THE CHALLENGE
Lever solves the #1 challenge for every company: hiring top talent. Recruiting is a hot market, growing 12-15% y/y on its own, and Applicant Tracking Systems like Lever are in high demand. We’ve already attracted an elite roster of customers including Netflix, Lyft, Foursquare, Reddit and Eventbrite, and we’re just getting started.

Lever is the only hiring software that is mobilizing the entire company to collaborate on hiring. Built on the technology that allows real-time collaboration in the Google Suite (our Co-Founder developed the technology, after all), we can support a true partnership between recruiters and managers. We’re able to make hiring faster, higher-quality, and more embedded into a company’s core culture.

We just closed our Series C, bringing our total funding to $70M, and now need to scale our Sales team to keep up with demand. We’re looking for a proven leader to help develop our quickly growing team of highly motivated Sales Development Representatives. The SDR team is the first point of contact for all sales efforts, and the team’s success is central to our move up market. You’ll manage a team and help them generate demand, interest, and excitement for Lever while creating a steady pipeline of business to arm the Sales team.

There’s no script, no one-size-fits-all solution. We’re consultative sales experts, and we train and invest in our smart, goal-oriented team to grow their careers here at Lever.

      "descriptionPlain": "THE CHALLENGE
Lever solves the #1 challenge for every company: hiring top talent. Recruiting is a hot market, growing 12-15% y/y on its own, and Applicant Tracking Systems like Lever are in high demand. We’ve already attracted an elite roster of customers including Netflix, Lyft, Foursquare, Reddit and Eventbrite, and we’re just getting started.

Lever is the only hiring software that is mobilizing the entire company to collaborate on hiring. Built on the technology that allows real-time collaboration in the Google Suite (our Co-Founder developed the technology, after all), we can support a true partnership between recruiters and managers. We’re able to make hiring faster, higher-quality, and more embedded into a company’s core culture.

We just closed our Series C, bringing our total funding to $70M, and now need to scale our sales team to keep up with demand. We’re looking for our head of sales enablement to help develop our quickly growing team of highly motivated Sales Development Representatives and Account Executives. This will be the first hire within our sales enablement org and you will partner directly with our SVP of Sales as well as Director of Sales Development. This role will allow you the space to creatively build a repeatable training playbook for onboarding new sales representatives as well as more established reps. You will own enablement and will collaborate with Lever's other departments including Product, Marketing and Customer Success to help reps be as productive and successful as possible.  

THE TEAM
Lever’s Sales team is a tight-knit team with diverse backgrounds--we’re seasoned salespeople, whip-smart new grads, and even a few former recruiters. Learn more about growing the team and our thoughts on career development from Sales Development Director, Ashley Kelly.
