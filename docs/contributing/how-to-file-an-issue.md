title: How to File an Issue
---

The Gatsby GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, documentation requests, and [submitting pull requests](/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request/).

To resolve your issue, please select the appropriate category:

- Bug Report
- Documentation

For bug reports, include in your issue:

- Follow the issue template prompting you for each entry
- A [reproduction](/contributing/how-to-make-a-reproducible-test-case/) for debugging and taking action

Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Browse the ["Get Support" section](/contributing/#get-support) to find a place for your questions.

## Special Note on Issues

If an issue is affecting you, start at the top of this list and complete as many tasks on the list as you can:

1. If there is an issue, add a reaction or more details to the issue to indicate that it's affecting you
2. If there is an issue and you can add more detail, write a comment describing how the problem is affecting you, OR if you can, write up a work-around or improvement for the issue
3. If there _is not_ an issue, write the most complete description of what's happening, preferably with a link to a Gatsby site that reproduces the problem or [create a reproducible test case](/contributing/how-to-make-a-reproducible-test-case/) where applicable
4. Offer to help fix the issue (and it is totally expected that you ask for help; open-source maintainers want to help contributors)
5. [Deliver a well-crafted, tested PR](/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request/)
