title: How to Contribute
---

We want contributing to Gatsby to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, new docs as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

## Not sure how to start contributing?

If you are worried or don't know where to start, check out our [where to participate](/contributing/where-to-participate/) page. You can reach out with questions to [@AskGatsbyJS](https://twitter.com/askgatsbyjs) on Twitter, and anyone from the Gatsby team on [Discord](https://gatsby.dev/discord). You can also [submit an issue](/contributing/how-to-file-an-issue/) and a maintainer can give you guidance!
