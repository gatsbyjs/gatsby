## What is a Conceptual Guide?

A Conceptual Guide provides a big-picture explanation of higher-level Gatsby concepts. Conceptual Guides are most useful for readers who want to build a deeper understanding of a particular topic.

Rather than focusing on specific technical details, Conceptual Guides take a step back to look at the broader picture. For example, it might explain [image optimizations](/docs/conceptual/using-gatsby-image/) or compare [build time and runtime data fetching](/docs/conceptual/data-fetching/).

You can think of a Conceptual Guide as a discussion. It compares the benefits and risks of different approaches. It provides additional historical context to explain how things ended up the way they are.

> For more information on Conceptual Guides, check out the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/explanation/), which the Gatsby docs are based on.

> **Note:** In the Divio system, these types of docs are called "Explanations" instead of "Conceptual Guides".

## Conceptual Guide template

Because of the open-ended nature of a Conceptual Guide, it's difficult to create a template for how to structure one.

Instead, here's a list of questions to consider as you're writing:

- What is the central, underlying concept for this topic? Why is that something worth learning about?
- What historical background or past decisions would be helpful for newcomers trying to understanding this concept?
- Are there any other solutions or approaches? What are the pros and cons of each approach?
- What other viewpoints should be considered?
