title: How to Run a Gatsby Workshop
---

Running a workshop focused on Gatsby.js is a fantastic way to teach a group of people how to create fast, accessible websites with in-person (or virtual) instruction.

We on the Gatsby team have run a number of in-person workshops, and you can read about some of our [initial findings](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2018-05-31-open-sourcing-gatsby-workshops/). If you are interested in running a workshop yourself, we welcome you to do so and offer this page of resources to help you.

Share your ideas and report how these workshops go for you in the [Open source repo](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) through issues and PRs (if you ran into problems with the workshops and/or have ideas of how to improve them) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) if you want to share an upcoming workshop you're running.

## Why you might want to host a workshop

Here are some advantages that we experienced in the workshops; if these appeal to you, you could consider hosting your own workshop at your work, a meetup, or any other setting that makes sense!

- _Dedicated time and place to learn:_ it’s easier to set aside time to learn something new when you are in a room with other people doing the same thing
- _Quicker problem-solving:_ you can usually get answers to your questions and solve problems faster than you could otherwise
- _Customized content:_ the workshop host can customize the workshop for the group’s needs ahead of time by sending out a survey, and the workshop can shift focus depending on real-time needs and questions of the group and individuals
