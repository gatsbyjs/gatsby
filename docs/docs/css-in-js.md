title: Enhance your styles with CSS-in-JS
overview: true

CSS-in-JS refers to a styling approach where styles are written in JavaScript instead of in external CSS files.

CSS-in-JS bridges the gap between CSS and JavaScript:

1. **Components**: you'll style your site with components, which integrates well with React's "everything is a component" philosophy
2. **Scoped**: this is a side effect of the first. Just like [CSS Modules](/docs/css-modules/), CSS-in-JS is scoped by default
3. **Dynamic**: style your site dynamically based on component state by integrating JavaScript variables
4. **Bonuses**: many CSS-in-JS libraries generate unique class names,automatic vendor prefixes, critical CSS, and implement many other features, depending on the library you choose

Read Max Stoiber's (creator of CSS-in-JS library [styled-components](/docs/styled-components/)) article [_Why I write CSS in JavaScript_](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js/).

_Note that this functionality is not a part of React or Gatsby, and requires using any of the many [third-party CSS-in-JS libraries](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js#css-in-js)._

This section contains guides for styling your site with some of the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries.
