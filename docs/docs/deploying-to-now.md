title: Deploying to Now
---

[ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/now) is a cloud platform for websites and serverless APIs, that you can use to deploy your Gatsby projects to your personal domain (or a free `.now.sh` suffixed URL).

This guide will show you how to get started in a few quick steps:

## Step 1: Installing Now CLI

To install their command-line interface with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), run the following command:

```shell
npm install -g now
```

## Step 2: Deploying

You can deploy your application by running the following command in the root of the project directory:

```shell
now
```

That's all! Your application will now deploy, and you will receive a link similar to the following: https://my-gatsby-project-fhcc9hnqc.now.sh/
