## CSS modules and Gatsby

Gatsby works out of the box with CSS Modules. Here is an [example site that uses CSS modules](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/using-css-modules).

## What is a CSS module?

Quoting from
[the CSS Module homepage](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules):

> A **CSS Module** is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names
> are scoped locally by default.

CSS Modules are very popular as they let you write CSS like normal but with a lot
more safety. The tool automatically makes class and animation names unique so
you don't have to worry about selector name collisions.

## When to use CSS modules

CSS Modules are highly recommended for those new to building with Gatsby (and
React in general).
