title: Creating a Generic Plugin
---

This section aims to explain the structure of a Gatsby plugin and the files you need to create one.

The idea of a generic plugin is to lay more emphasis on the makeup of a plugin rather than the specific labels ([source](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/creating-a-source-plugin/), [transformer](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/creating-a-transformer-plugin/), [local](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/creating-a-local-plugin/)) that are [selected based on functionality](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/naming-a-plugin/). As seen in the [what is a plugin doc](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/what-is-a-plugin/), a plugin is a piece of software that acts as an add-on and gives a Gatsby site additional functionality.

Plugins contain a file, usually in the project root, called `package.json` - this file holds various metadata relevant to the project. The `package.json` file is also used to provide information to npm that identifies the project and allows npm to handle the project's dependencies.

## Initializing your plugin project

To initialize a `package.json` for your project, run the following command:

```shell
npm init
```

Once you've run the command you'll see a series of options listed in the command-line interface (CLI). Those you select are stored in your `package.json` which contains some of the [files Gatsby looks for in a Plugin](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/files-gatsby-looks-for-in-a-plugin/)

## What happens in a generic plugin?

In a generic plugin the `gatsby-node.js` file enables the use of [gatsby node APIs](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/). These APIs, such as `createPage`, `createResolvers`, and `sourceNodes`, manipulate the Node(s) in a Gatsby site. A [Node](/docs/node-creation/) is the smallest unit of data in Gatsby. You can create a Node using the [createNode](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createNode) action.

In `gatsby-node.js` you can carry out functions with these APIs, such as:

- Loading API keys
- Sending calls to APIs
- Creating Gatsby-nodes using the API response
- Creating individual pages from nodes

> A good use case of the above would be a plugin that gets data from an API.

### An example of a generic plugin

[sourceNodes](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#sourceNodes) is a lifecycle API that a plugin can use to create Nodes. An example of how to implement a function using `sourceNodes` is shown below:

```javascript:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.sourceNodes = ({ actions, createNodeId, createContentDigest }) => {
  const nodeData = {
    title: "Test Node",
    description: "Testing the node ",
  }
  const newNode = {
    ...nodeData,
    id: createNodeId("TestNode-testid"),
    internal: {
      type: "TestNode",
      contentDigest: createContentDigest(nodeData),
    },
  }
  actions.createNode(newNode)
}
```

The above code block creates a node called `"Test Node"` as seen from the `title` parameter. If this process is successful restarting the server will make the `allTestNode` query available at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.

> Libraries like [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) can be used to handle calls in the `gatsby-node.js` file

Though all plugins have the same structure, their name signals what functionality they provide. See the [naming a plugin](/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/naming-a-plugin) section for more information.
