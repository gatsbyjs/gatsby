title: Building Themes

The quickest way to get up and running with a workspace for building themes is to use the official [`gatsby-starter-theme-workspace`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-theme-workspace) starter.

/>

To get started, run:

```shell
gatsby new gatsby-theme-my-theme gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-theme-workspace
```

This will generate a new project for you. The file tree will look like this:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ example
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-config.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-theme-minimal
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-config.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock
```

Yarn workspaces are a great way to set up a project for theme development because they support housing multiple packages in a single parent directory and link them together.

For Gatsby theme development, that means you can keep multiple themes and example sites together in a single project, and develop them locally.

> ðŸ’¡ If you prefer, you can develop themes as [local plugins](/docs/creating-a-local-plugin/). Using `yarn link` or `npm link` are also viable alternatives. In general, Gatsby recommends the yarn workspaces approach for building themes, and that's what the starter and this guide will reflect.

> ðŸ’¡ The starter takes care of all of the configuration for developing a theme using yarn workspaces. If you're interested in more detail on this setup, check out [this blog post](/blog/2019-05-22-setting-up-yarn-workspaces-for-theme-development/).

## `package.json`

The `package.json` in the root of the new project is primarily responsible for setting up the yarn workspaces. In this case, there are two workspaces, `gatsby-theme-minimal` and `example`.

```json:title=my-theme/package.json
{
  "name": "gatsby-starter-theme-workspace",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "yarn workspace example build"
  },
  // highlight-start
  "workspaces": ["gatsby-theme-minimal", "example"]
  // highlight-end
}
```

## `/gatsby-theme-minimal`

The `/gatsby-theme-minimal` directory is the starting point of the new theme you'll develop.

Inside it you'll find:

- `gatsby-config.js`: An empty gatsby-config that you can use as a starting point for building functionality into your theme.
- `index.js`: Since themes also function as plugins, this is an empty file that Gatsby requires in order to use this theme as a plugin.
- `package.json`: A file listing the dependencies that your theme will pull in when people install it. Gatsby should be a peer dependency.

## `/example`

The `/example` directory is an example Gatsby site that installs and uses the local theme, `gatsby-theme-minimal`.

Inside it you'll find:

- `gatsby-config.js`: Specifies which theme to use and any other one-off configuration a site might need.
- `/src`: Contains source code such as custom pages or components that might live in a user's site.

## Publishing a Theme

After building your theme, you may want to publish it for the Gatsby community by releasing it on npm.

### Accessibility

A Gatsby theme is a Gatsby site, therefore building with accessibility in mind is critical. Check out these [tips on making your sites (and themes!) accessible](/docs/conceptual/making-your-site-accessible/).
