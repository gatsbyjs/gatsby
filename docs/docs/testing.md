One of the benefits of building a Gatsby project is the ability to add automated tests for your components, APIs, pages, and more. With Gatsby, you can employ modern tooling like Jest, Cypress, Testing Library, Storybook, Enzyme, and any other JavaScript testing tool to build a robust React web application.

In these guides, you can learn the common tools and setup instructions for adding testing functionality to your Gatsby project. There are likely more possibilities than what are listed here: search the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+testing) to chime in about your desired testing use case, or [file an issue](/contributing/how-to-file-an-issue/) of your own.
