title: Working with Fonts and Typography
---

In this section, you will learn Gatsby’s approach to [fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Fonts) and typography. You will also learn how to use different fonts for styling text in your project.

The three different kinds of fonts covered in this section are:

- **[Local fonts](/docs/how-to/styling/using-local-fonts/)**: For when you have your own custom font file.
- **[Web fonts](/docs/how-to/styling/using-web-fonts/)**: For when you want to use a font from a service like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [Typekit Web Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/typekit).
- **[Typography.js framework](/docs/using-typography-js/)**: For when you want to use a predefined set of fonts from the [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) library.

Gatsby doesn’t have an opinion about which [styling approach](/docs/styling/) you choose. Most every possible option is supported through official and community plugins. (If there isn’t a plugin yet for your favorite option, consider [contributing](/docs/creating-plugins) one!)
