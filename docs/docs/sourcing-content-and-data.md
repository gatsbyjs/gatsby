### Notes on this document:

Tl;dr: This doc is part of creating an onboarding experience more similar to express/flask/create-react-app/react-static). It will be like a `create-gatsby-app` experience. This will include making it clearer that you can start building with Gatsby without GraphQL (through adding unstructured data, for example) and make it clear that GraphQL is a more "advanced" requirement for ambitious use cases. It will also involve building different CLI's for different types of sites.

### Why make these big changes?

- GraphQL learning curve is one of the top 3 pain points of Gatsby users
- GraphQL learning curve drives many people away from Gatsby
- Many people think GraphQL is a requirement for using Gatsby, which isn't true
- Probably 5% need GraphQL but we're making 100% of them go through GraphQL.
