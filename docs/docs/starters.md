title: "Gatsby Starters"
---

The Gatsby CLI tool lets you install “starters”. These are boilerplate Gatsby sites maintained by the community.

`gatsby new` helps you start your project by cloning the boilerplate, installing dependencies, and clearing Git history.

When creating a new site, you can optionally specify a starter to base your new site on, either with the `[URL]` of the `[GIT_USER_NAME/REPO]` e.g.

`gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [URL_OF_STARTER_GITHUB_REPO]`
or
`gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] [GIT_USER_NAME/REPO]`

For example, to quickly create a blog using Gatsby, you could install the Gatsby Starter Blog by running:

`gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

This downloads the files and initializes the site by running `npm install`

Or, you can use the `[GIT_USER_NAME/REPO]`

`gatsby new blog gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

If you don't specify a custom starter, your site will be created from the [default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

> Learn [how to make a starter](/docs/creating-a-starter/) in the Gatsby docs. Starters can be created for your team(s) only, or distributed to the broader community. It's up to you!
