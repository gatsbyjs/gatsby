title: How to file an issue
---

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues) is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests.

If you want your issue to be resolved quickly, please include in your issue:

* Gatsby version, node.js version, OS version
* The contents of your `gatsby-config.js` and `package.json` as well as your
  `gatsby-node.js`, `gatsby-browser.js` `gatsby-ssr.js` files depending on
  changes you've made there.

Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=gatsby) (**gatsby** tag) and the [Reactiflux Discord](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZjGY5n) #gatsby channels are better places to get help.

### Special Note on Issues

If an issue is affecting you, start at the top of this list and complete as many tasks on the list as you can:

1. If there is an issue, +1 the issue to indicate that it's affecting you
2. If there is an issue and you can add more detail, write a comment describing how the bug is affecting OR if you can, write up a work-around for the bug
3. If there _is not_ an issue, write the most complete description of what's happening, preferably with link to a Gatsby site that reproduces the problem
4. Offer to help fix the bug (and it is totally expected that you ask for help; open-source maintainers want to help contributors)
5. Deliver a well-crafted, tested PR
