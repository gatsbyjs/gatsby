title: Preparing Your Environment
---

To get started with Gatsby, you'll need to make sure you have the following software tools installed:

1. [Node.js](/docs/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system)
2. [npm CLI](/docs/tutorial/part-zero/#check-your-nodejs-installation)
3. [Gatsby CLI](/docs/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli)

For step-by-step installation instructions and detailed explanations of the required software, head on over to the [Gatsby tutorial](/docs/tutorial/part-zero/).

The [quick start](/docs/quick-start/) is also available for intermediate to advanced developers.

> **Note:** If you work for an Enterprise-level company where you are unable to pull from public GitHub repositories, you can [still set up Gatsby](/docs/using-gatsby-professionally/using-gatsby-professionally/setting-up-gatsby-without-gatsby-new/).
