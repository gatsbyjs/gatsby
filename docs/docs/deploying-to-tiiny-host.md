In this guide, you will learn how to deploy your Gatsby site to [tiiny.host](https://tiiny.host).

[tiiny.host](https://tiiny.host/) is a tool for quickly hosting static websites.

The tool is perfect for prototyping and sharing your Gatsby site online in a few clicks.

This guide will show you how to deploy in two steps:

## Step 1: Prepare your build

Build your site by running this command in your project's root directory:

```shell
gatsby build
```

This will generate a publishable version of your site in the `./public` folder.

## Step 2: Deploy

Zip your `./public` folder and head over to https://tiiny.host.

Here, enter a subdomain, upload your zip file and click `Launch`.

And that's it, you're done! There is no need to register and your site will be live for 7 days or can be extended on the Pro plan.
