title: Local HTTPS
---

Gatsby provides an easy way to use a local HTTPS server during development, thanks to [devcert](https://github.com/davewasmer/devcert). When you enable the `https` option, a private key and certificate file will be created for your project and used by the development server.

## Usage (Automatic HTTPS)

Start the development server using `npm run develop` as usual, and add either the `-S` or `--https` flag.

    $ npm run develop -- --https

## Setup

When setting up a development SSL certificate for the first time, you may be asked to type in your password after starting the development environment:

    info setting up SSL certificate (may require elevated permissions)

    Password:

On windows, the prompt will differ:

    A password is required to access the secure certificate authority key
    used for signing certificates.

    If this is the first time this has run, then this is to set the password
    for future use.  If any new certificates are signed later, you will need
    to use this same password.

    Please enter the CA password:

This is _only_ required the first time you are using Gatsby's HTTPS feature on your machine, and when you are creating a brand new certificate.

After typing in your password, `devcert` will install the CA certificate in your operating system trusted certs store.  For various browsers (Firefox, and Chrome on Linux) it needs to use a utility called `certutil`.

### In case `certutil` is not installed on your machine:

`devcert` is configured to not install `certutil` automatically.  You will need to do that yourself, if you want it to be able to setup the trust automatically.

To install `certutil`, you need to install the `nss tools` package(s).  The exact procedure will differ depending on your operating system.

On a linux OS, you should be able to simply run one of the following, depending on the flavor:
```sh
# Debian based (Ubuntu)
sudo apt install libnss3-tools

# RHEL based (Fedora)
sudo yum install nss-tools

# OpenSuse
sudo zypper install mozilla-nss-tools
```

On MacOS, you should be able to run:
```sh
brew install nss
```

Windows is a different story.  There's not many precompiled binaries out there.  If you search, you should find some, but otherwise, you will need to compile the library yourself.

If you choose not to install `certutil`, you may get the following errors/prompts:

- If you use Chrome on Linux:

      WARNING: It looks like you have Chrome installed, but you specified
      'skipCertutilInstall: true'. Unfortunately, without installing
      certutil, it's impossible get Chrome to trust devcert's certificates
      The certificates will work, but Chrome will continue to warn you that
      they are untrusted.

- If you have Firefox installed, `devcert` will try to utilize Firefox itself to trust the certificate

      devcert was unable to automatically configure Firefox. You'll need to
      complete this process manually. Don't worry though - Firefox will walk
      you through it.

      When you're ready, hit any key to continue. Firefox will launch and
      display a wizard to walk you through how to trust the devcert
      certificate. When you are finished, come back here and we'll finish up.
      (If Firefox doesn't start, go ahead and start it and navigate to
      http://localhost:52175 in a new tab.)

      If you are curious about why all this is necessary, check out
      https://github.com/davewasmer/devcert#how-it-works
      <Press any key to launch Firefox wizard>

  - You can press enter here, and it will launch Firefox for you.

  - If you wish to have trust support on Firefox, tell the point-and-click wizard `this certificate can identify websites`, and click OK. Otherwise, you may hit cancel and close the browser, then key return to finish building. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine.**

### After `devcert` setup process

You can open the development server at [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000) and enjoy the HTTPS goodness ✨. Of course, you may change the port according to your setup.

### Management of certificates generated by devcert

If you want to do some maintenance/cleanup of the certificates generated by `devcert`, please refer to [devcert-cli](https://github.com/davewasmer/devcert-cli/blob/master/README.md)

## Custom Key and Certificate Files

You may find that you need a custom key and certificate file for https if you use multiple
machines for development (or if your dev environment is containerized in Docker).

If you need to use a custom https setup, you can pass the `--https`, `--key-file`,
`--cert-file`, and `--ca-file` flags to `npm run develop`.

- `--cert-file` [relative/absolute path to ssl certificate file]
- `--key-file` [relative/absolute path to ssl key file]
- `--ca-file` [relative/absolute path to ssl certificate authority file]

See the example command:

```shell
# Using relative paths
$ gatsby develop --https --key-file ../relative/path/to/key.key --cert-file ../relative/path/to/cert.crt --ca-file ../relative/path/to/ca.crt

# Or using absolute paths
$ gatsby develop --https --key-file /absolute/path/to/key.key --cert-file /absolute/path/to/cert.crt --ca-file /absolute/path/to/ca.crt
```

Usage of the `--ca-file` flag is only required if your certificate is signed by a certificate authority.

If your certificate is self-signed, then do not include the `--ca-file` flag. Also, if you want your browser to trust a self-signed certificate, you will need to add it to your operating system (or browser's, in Firefox's case) root certificate store in order for your browser to trust it.

In most cases, the `--https` passed by itself is easier and more convenient to get local https.

---

Automatic certificates issued with the `--https` flag are issued to `localhost` by default, unless you have used the `--host` flag. If you have, a record in your hosts file will automatically be configured to point the defined host to `127.0.0.1`. At this time, ip addresses defined by `--host` are not supported.
