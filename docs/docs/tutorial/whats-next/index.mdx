## Introduction

Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the Gatsby Tutorial. But the fun is just beginning!

Here are some resources that you might find helpful as you continue on your journey with Gatsby.

## Learn more

Check out the rest of Gatsby's documentation, which is broken down into the following categories:

* [**How-To Guides**](/docs/how-to/): Practical step-by-step guides to help you achieve a specific goal. Most useful when you're trying to get something done.
* [**Reference Guides**](/docs/reference/): Nitty-gritty technical descriptions of how Gatsby works. Most useful when you need detailed information about Gatsby's APIs.
* [**Conceptual Guides**](/docs/conceptual/): Big-picture explanations of higher-level Gatsby concepts. Most useful for building understanding of a particular topic.

Not sure where to start? Here are a few Gatsby features that weren't covered in the Tutorial:

* [Client-only routes](/docs/how-to/routing/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication): These are helpful for pages that require user authentication or that load different content based on URL query parameters.
* [Gatsby Node APIs](/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/): You can create a `gatsby-node.js` if you need more control over the nodes in the data layer or other parts of Gatsby's build process.
* [Serverless functions](/docs/reference/functions/): Build APIs for your Gatsby site and run them in Gatsby Cloud. No extra server maintenance necessary!
