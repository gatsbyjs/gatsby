    Hey. I’m Kris. I’m an interactive designer / developer. I grew up in Umeå,
    in northern Sweden, but I now live in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently enjoying
    a hybrid Art Director + Lead Product Engineer role at a small startup called
    Nomad Health. Before that, I was a Product (Engineering) Manager at Tumblr.
    Before that, I worked at agencies. Before that, I was a baby. I like to
    design things, and then I like to build those things. I occasionally take on
    freelance projects. Feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting
    project that you want to collaborate on. Or if you just want to say hello,
    that’s cool too.

    product-oriented approach to development, allowing me to see the big picture
    and ensuring quality products are completed on time. I have a passion for
    modern front end JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue, and I have
    substantial experience on the back end with an interest in Node and
    container based deployment with Docker and AWS.
