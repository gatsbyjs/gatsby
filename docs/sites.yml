    Hey. I’m Kris. I’m an interactive designer / developer. I grew up in Umeå,
    in northern Sweden, but I now live in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently enjoying
    a hybrid Art Director + Lead Product Engineer role at a small startup called
    Nomad Health. Before that, I was a Product (Engineering) Manager at Tumblr.
    Before that, I worked at agencies. Before that, I was a baby. I like to
    design things, and then I like to build those things. I occasionally take on
    freelance projects. Feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting
    project that you want to collaborate on. Or if you just want to say hello,
    that’s cool too.

    I’m a senior frontend engineer with 8 years of experience building websites
    and web applications. I’m interested in leading creative, multidisciplinary
    engineering teams. I’m a creative technologist, merging photography, art,
    and design into engineering and visa versa. I take a pragmatic,
    product-oriented approach to development, allowing me to see the big picture
    and ensuring quality products are completed on time. I have a passion for
    modern frontend JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue, and I have
    substantial experience on the backend with an interest in Node and
    container based deployment with Docker and AWS.

    Playlist Detective is an attempt to ease music discovery with playlists. Back in the days, people were sharing mixtapes - some songs we knew and others we didn't, therefore expanding our musical horizons.

    Playlists are the same, and playlist detective lets you search for songs or artists you like in order to stumble on your new favorite songs.

    It uses Algolia for the search.

    AMVI, Amamos Vivir Cada Día A.C. is a Mexican non-profit organisation helping children with degenerative illnesses by fulfilling their dreams and helping their families financially, but also with personal support. During the Covid-19 crisis, their donations have plummeted since they did not have a website, so I decided to help by building this site for them using Gatsby, TypeScript and Styled-Components, proudly hosted on Netlify who helped the cause with a free pro plan.
