One of the most exciting things we’re working on at Gatsby right now is themes.

You can find more details in [the announcement post](/blog/2018-11-11-introducing-gatsby-themes/) and [why we think themes are important](/blog/2019-01-31-why-themes/), but the short version is this:

**Gatsby themes allow you to focus only on the parts of the site and app building process that you _need to care about_ by abstracting the rest away into a package.**

What this means in practical terms is that you can use Gatsby themes to create a site with:

- `package.json` with 4 installed packages (`gatsby`, `react`, `react-dom`, and your theme)
- `gatsby-config.js` with metadata and a reference to your theme
- a folder full of Markdown files for content

And _that’s it_.

No code. No assembling plugins. Just writing content.

## Learn how to build a Gatsby theme.

Recently I had the pleasure of building a theme from scratch with Gatsby’s own [John Otander](https://twitter.com/4lpine) live on [my weekly livestream](https://twitch.tv/jlengstorf).

On the stream, we covered multiple topics:

1. How to build a Gatsby theme from scratch
2. How to create [child themes](/blog/2019-01-29-themes-update-child-theming-and-component-shadowing/#child-theming)
3. How to use [component shadowing](/blog/2019-01-29-themes-update-child-theming-and-component-shadowing/#component-shadowing)
4. How to install and use a Gatsby theme

The code we built is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jlengstorf/livestream-gatsby-themes) — use it as a starting point to build your own Gatsby themes today!
