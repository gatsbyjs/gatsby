## Challenge 12: Add Gated Content to Your Website

Did you know Gatsby can be used for websites as well as dynamic apps? Dustin Schau presented about this topic at Gatsby Days London:

For example, if your project needs private routes, or sections of the site that only authenticated users can view, Gatsby can enable that with just a plugin, or by creating a few components from scratch. In the following resources we invite you to try both paths, and experiment with powerful third-party authentication services.

### Gatsby for Apps Resources

#### Overview & Examples

First, get familiar with how [Gatsby works for apps](/docs/adding-app-and-website-functionality/).

Then [watch this helpful livestream](/blog/2019-03-21-add-auth0-to-gatsby-livestream/) that covers adding an authentication service called Auth0 to your site.

Lastly, play with live examples of these features by signing in to the [Gatsby Swag Store](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Gatsby Cloud](https://gatsbyjs.com/cloud)

#### The Plugin Path

To get started quickly, use `gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths` to create private client routes in your Gatsby site. [Learn more](/packages/gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths).

#### The Hand-Rolled Path

[Read this tutorial and handy illustration](/docs/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication/) that walks you through adding private routes and authentication in Gatsby.

### What to Do If You Need Help

If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the [Gatsby community](/contributing/community/) and the [ASKGatsbyJS](https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS) Twitter account.
