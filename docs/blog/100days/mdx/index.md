_Gatsby was named the [#1 new technology to learn in 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/02/10-hottest-tech-skills-that-could-pay-off-most-in-2020-says-new-report.html)!_

_To help you learn about Gatsby and our ecosystem, we invite you to take the #100DaysOfGatsby challenge! If you are new to Gatsby, you can follow along with our beginner-friendly weekly prompts. Or if you are familiar with Gatsby and want to go deeper, we invite you to [build your first Gatsby Theme](/docs/themes/building-themes/)._

## Challenge 5: Mix Markdown and React Using MDX

Use React components within your Markdown-based blog posts!

Markdown is a great markup language for creating human readable, long form content. A writer on your team can use Markdown’s friendly syntax and contribute content to a site without having to edit HTML or JSX directly.

Today we invite you to use MDX, a new format that lets you add components in your Markdown documents. Now, editors can add interactive and styled elements to their documents, not just static, plain text.

### Challenge Resources

Use [Gatsby’s MDX tutorial](/docs/mdx/) and substitute the example “chart component” with the [“form component” you created](/blog/100days/react-component/) in a previous challenge.

Bonus: Learn about an advanced [MDX feature, “shortcodes”(https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes)]. Then enable an example of this feature by using a Gatsby plugin from the community, [gatsby-mdx-embed](/packages/@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed/).

### What to Do If You Need Help

If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the [Gatsby community](/contributing/community/) and the [ASKGatsbyJS](https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS) Twitter account. You can find fellow Gatsby Developers on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/gatsby), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/), [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js), and [Dev](https://dev.to/t/gatsby).

For this challenge, you can also use the [MDX support resources](https://mdxjs.com/support)
