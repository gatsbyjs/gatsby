Back before the world changed so suddenly, our quarterly Gatsby Days was an in-person gathering: A way to assemble the Gatsby community, guest presenters, and Gatsby team for a day long conference and celebration-slash-deep-dive into all things Gatsby. Obviously we can't do things the same way right now, but that's not going to stop us!

Join us for Virtual Gatsby Days, June 2nd and 3rd: Registration is now open at https://www.gatsbyjs.com/virtual-gatsby-days.

Virtual Gatsby Days will continue to focus on the future of modern website development, use cases, and deep dive into topics such as what’s new in the web technology stack. You’ll have the opportunity to participate in a Q&A with Gatsby creators, Kyle Mathews and Sam Bhagwat, hear other Gatsby core team members speak, and connect with the Gatsby community. Sessions run 9am to noon PST on both days.
