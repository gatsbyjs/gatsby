excerpt: At Gatsby, supporting agencies as you work with clients to create compelling sites and apps that delight users is important to us. Equally important is supporting those building the overall ecosystem of CMS, infrastructure tools, and other technologies that form the foundations of today’s emerging modern web. Today we are inviting Agency Partners and Technology Partners to join our new Gatsby Partner Program, designed with both of these priorities firmly in mind.

I'm pleased to announce a brand new [Gatsby Partner Program](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/partner) for digital agencies and website technology companies!

Gatsby just celebrated our fifth birthday. During that time, we've seen massive growth with 2000+ open source plugins, 3300 contributors, 200K public sites, the launch of Gatsby Cloud, and strong adoption among developers and agencies. One thing has become completely clear in our half decade thus far: the web is changing in a fundamental way. We're in the midst of a true paradigm shift as the long-standing monolithic CMS -- the way the web has been built for the past twenty years -- is getting disrupted. Developers are finding new tools that help them optimize for performance without compromising on user experience. And digital agencies, more than anyone, are on the forefront of this website revolution.

It's important to Gatsby that we support agencies as you work with clients to create compelling sites and apps that delight users. Equally important is supporting those building the overall ecosystem of CMS, infrastructure tools, and other technologies that are foundations of the modern web. We designed the Gatsby Partner Program with both of these priorities firmly in mind, which is why it covers two different types of partners, Agency Partners and Technology Partners. Let's take a look at both.

## Gatsby Agency Partners

Agencies are challenged to meet the needs of diverse clients while trying to optimize for web performance, SEO, security, and many other business objectives. Gatsby has been helping solve these challenges with performance improvements, efficiencies, scalability, and security all built right into the framework. We’re now adding a human support component by introducing a strong partner program to provide technical support, marketing and sales materials, and a path to submit referrals, plus a certification program.

### Benefits for Agency Partners

- **Growth:** Tap into the vast and varied Gatsby ecosystem by connecting with one of the most exciting website frameworks around.
- **Visibility:** Get exclusive access to what’s in development at Gatsby and become a beta tester for new products and features.
- **Training:** Have confidence that you’re getting the most out of Gatsby by accessing training materials and a connection with the Gatsby team.
- **Certification:** Leverage Gatsby’s brand to elevate your business and give clients confidence they’re working with a Gatsby certified agency.

> “Partnering with Gatsby has been a strong driver for growth. Our clients love the performance benefits and our developers are happy to use tools they already love.”
> -- **Dennis Brotzky, Founding Partner, [Narative](https://www.narative.co/)**

## Gatsby Technology Partners

For makers of CMS, design tools, and other web technologies, the Gatsby Technology Partner Program assists you in building that first-class integration with Gatsby Cloud -- and harnessing the power of the entire Gatsby ecosystem.

In this API-driven world, developers want to use the best tool for the job and this is especially true for websites and apps. The new Gatsby Partner Program makes this even easier by empowering website technology companies to build compatible tools with Gatsby, improving the entire web development experience. For example, the best combination for building a high-performing website might be Auth0 for authentication, a headless CMS for managing content, Netlify for hosting, and Gatsby for the presentation layer. Gatsby’s new partner program makes it easier for these -- or any other -- technologies to integrate with Gatsby, which is one of the most popular website frameworks today. It provides technology partners opportunities to grow, collaborate, and provide better service to customers.

### Benefits for Technology Partners

- **Create a better user experience:** Developers care about their tools and building a first-class integration with Gatsby creates an even better user experience.
- **Grow with Gatsby:** Tap into the extensive and evolving Gatsby ecosystem by connecting with one of the most exciting and popular website frameworks around.
- **Increase usage and sales:** Build a first-class experience for developers to increase usage and sales.

> "Partnering with Gatsby as a first-class integration partner has been a huge benefit to Contentful’s customers. This partnership helps our customers seamlessly improve site speed and SEO performance, leading to a better customer experience and increased conversions. We’re proud to support the rapidly growing Gatsby community and build the ecosystem."
