*hint — the solution isn't reverting to an idealized "simpler" way of
working on the web*

*Move problem statement here — that working in JS world feels like riding runaway
train or surfing overly aggressive wave*

Advanced technologies don't emerge into the world fully grown like
Athena leaping from Zeus' forehead. Instead like babies, they are born
quite helpless and weak and must be slowly nurtured through their
awkward younger years until they are finally productive technology
adults.

Software technology adoption goes through multiple stages.

1. R&D / Custom built
2. Productization
3. Commodization

## R&D and custom built solutions

The first stage is the time of *R&D and custom built solutions*.
Sophesticated technology groups with advanced needs start running into
problems that existing solutiosn don't solve so feel compelled to build
new technology or cobble together existing tools into novel packages.

So the Googles, Facebooks, Amazon, Apples of the world are running
applications in containers distributed across dozens of data centers
*years or decades* before Docker and Kubernetes came on the scene.
Similiarly tools like Google Closure Compiler and GWT pioneered advanced
Javascript building and bundling techniquges while the rest of us were
still *manually adding script tags to HTML pages*.

## Productization

As time goes on, more and more organizations start to run into the same
problems as these early pioneers and the ideas they pioneered start to
leak out into open source projects.

These new open source *software products* see rapid adoption from early adopters
and improve quickly. They generate widespread controversy as brash early
adopters loudly market the new tools generating pushback from groups
heavily invested in older tools.

## Commodization

As time goes on, more and more of the complexity and sharp edges of the
early-stage product are solved until at last the software product is the
"new normal" which begineers are taught and is taken for granted.

This is a widely understood pattern and has repeated itself over and
over the past ~60 years since computers came on the scene.

Microprocessors, operating systems, compilers, databases, the internet,
email all had long awakward adolesants periods where they were seen as
toys or niche tools before growing up to dominate their respective
ecosystems—to the point that we struggle to remember what it was like
before they existed.

## Adopting new technologies

Long-lived organizations learn to surf the successive waves of incoming
new technologies by picking points on the technology life cycle to adopt
new tools and techniques. Some need the most advanced technologies and
are vorocious adopters and inventors. Others lag years behind.

Or as [Erik Meijer summarized
it](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.72.868&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

`Change Function = F(Perceived Crisis/Perceived Pain of Adoption)`

Organizations in rapidly growing industries have many competitors and
are in a constant state of competative crisis so despite high adoption
pain, quickly adopt new technologies.

Normally this works out nicely for everyone. The pain of developing new
technologies is borne by those that with the greatest need and everyone
else (the vast majority) can wait until things settle down and mature so
adoption is fairly painless.

## Javascript in crisis

* everyone has to build for the web
* tools take a while to mature (the critical path for improving tools
used by 100s of thousands of engineers often goes through surprisingly
few people and they can only work so fast).
* enormous competative pressure — the internet pits everyone against
each other. Dropping one service for another is easy. Everyone has to level
up quickly or get left behind.
* Suggests new tools (React, Webpack, Redux, GraphQL, etc.) *are
actually dramatically better* as sophesticated companies under enormous
competative pressure are rapidly adopting new web tools.

New tools get widely adopted within *months*(!!!). New Javascript
projects can get 1000s of stars on GitHub within days. Bewilidering
abundance of choices.

## Riding the runaway Javascript train

![Javascript engineering riding runaway train](runaway-train.jpg)*Terrified Javascript Engineer riding the runaway Javascript train*

Highly unsettling for many engineers and organizations. Those most
comfortable being mid to late adopters are forced into becoming early
adopters.

## Things don't get better until they're made better

* stay away if you can. Tools are rapidly maturing and consolidating.
* If you can't (you probably can't) — accept building for the web is
much more complex than it used to be.
* Budget more for training and hiring more senior engineers to work on
your web products.
* Invest in open source. They're are many engineers who'd love to work
full-time on open source code. Identify critical tools for your
organization and invest in them. Very high leverage investment as you
gain access to some of the best engineers and the rest of your
engineering organization learns from working with them.

## As one layer of technology matures, they become the building blocks for the next generation of tools.

New breed of web tools that take for granted new web technologies.

Gatsby excemplifies this. Gensis was I wanted easy way to build
really fast websites with all my favorite web tools. Wraps React,
webpack, markdown to make it really easy to build websites out of these
building blocks without any configuration.
