Whether we gather in person or online, Gatsby Days conferences are all about the collective experiences and perspectives of the amazing Gatsby community 💜.

The next Gatsby Days will take place on June 2-3, 2020, from 1:00-3:00pm EST each day. This is a virtual event and will be live-streamed on YouTube. This means all speakers will need a computer, decent internet connection, and some kind of microphone/camera setup (the camera in your computer is great!) All speakers will receive a \$500.00 stipend from Gatsby following the conference.

Please make sure to [submit your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjUpqpmRL18ydo_PmC4jxvPG8xhOlix43KeRHOhUbPp3u7Mw/viewform?usp=sf_link) NO LATER THAN Friday, April 24th, 2020 at 11:59pm PST. We are reviewing submissions as they come in, so submitting early is an advantage.
