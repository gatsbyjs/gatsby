# gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud

⚠️ This plugin will be deprecated as Gatsby Cloud is being discontinued. [Learn more](https://www.netlify.com/blog/gatsby-cloud-evolution/).

Automatically generates a `_headers.json` file and a `_redirects.json` file at the root of the public folder to configure
headers and redirects on Gatsby Cloud.

By default, the plugin will add some basic security headers. You can add or replace headers through the plugin config.

**Please note:** This plugin is autoinstalled on Gatsby Cloud to ensure the latest compatible version, there is no need to install it locally unless you wish to add plugin config.

## Install

```shell
npm install gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud
```

## How to use

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`]
}
```

## Configuration

If you just need the critical assets, you don't need to add any additional
config. However, if you want to add headers, remove default headers, or
transform the given headers, you can use the following configuration options:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`,
      options: {
        headers: {}, // option to add more headers. `Link` headers are transformed by the below criteria
        allPageHeaders: [], // option to add headers for all pages. `Link` headers are transformed by the below criteria
        mergeSecurityHeaders: true, // boolean to turn off the default security headers
        mergeLinkHeaders: true, // boolean to turn off the default gatsby js headers
        mergeCachingHeaders: true, // boolean to turn off the default caching headers
        transformHeaders: (headers, path) => headers, // optional transform for manipulating headers under each path (e.g.sorting), etc.
        generateMatchPathRewrites: true, // boolean to turn off automatic creation of redirect rules for client only paths
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

### Headers

You should pass in an object with string keys (representing the paths) and an
array of strings for each header.

An example:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`,
      options: {
        headers: {
          "/*": [
            "Basic-Auth: someuser:somepassword anotheruser:anotherpassword",
          ],
          "/my-page": [
            // matching headers (by type) are replaced by Gatsby Cloud with more specific routes
            "Basic-Auth: differentuser:differentpassword",
          ],
        },
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

You should be able to reference assets imported through JavaScript in the `static` folder. Do not specify the public path in the config, as the plugin will provide it for you.

If you want to preload files that you import through webpack in your application (e.g. somewhere in `src`), use the `setHeadComponents` API like shown in [Preload your fonts](/docs/how-to/styling/using-local-fonts/#preload-your-fonts).

The `_headers.json` file does not inherit headers, and it will replace any
matching headers it finds in more specific routes. For example, if you add a
link to the root wildcard path (`/*`), it will be replaced by any more
specific path. If you want a resource to put linked across the site, you will
have to add to every path. To make this easier, the plugin provides the
`allPageHeaders` option to inject the same headers on every path.

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`,
      options: {
        allPageHeaders: [
          "Link: </static/my-logo.png>; rel=preload; as=image",
        ],
        headers: {
          "/*": [
            "Basic-Auth: someuser:somepassword anotheruser:anotherpassword",
          ],
        },
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

### Redirects

You can create redirects using the [`createRedirect`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createRedirect) action.

In addition to the options provided by the Gatsby API, you can pass these options specific to this plugin:

| Attribute    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `statusCode` | Overrides the HTTP status code which is set to `302` by default or `301` when [`isPermanent`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createRedirect) is `true`. You can set one here. For example, `200` for rewrites, or `404` for a custom error page. |

An example:

```js:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = ({ actions }) => {
  const { createRedirect } = actions

  createRedirect({ fromPath: "/old-url", toPath: "/new-url", isPermanent: true })
  createRedirect({ fromPath: "/url", toPath: "/zn-CH/url", Language: "zn" })
  createRedirect({
    fromPath: "/url_that_is/not_pretty",
    toPath: "/pretty/url",
    statusCode: 200,
  })
  createRedirect({
    fromPath: "/packages/*",
    toPath: "/plugins/*",
  })
}
```

Redirect rules are automatically added for [client only paths](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication/). The plugin uses the [matchPath](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-internals-terminology/#matchpath) syntax to match all possible requests in the range of your client-side routes and serves the HTML file for the client-side route. Without it, only the exact route of the client-side route works.

If those rules are conflicting with custom rules or if you want to have more control over them you can disable them in [configuration](#configuration) by setting `generateMatchPathRewrites` to `false`.

An asterisk, `*`, will match anything that follows. i.e. `/deprecated-packages/gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud/` will be redirected to `/plugins/gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud/`.

### HTTP Strict Transport Security

[HSTS Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)

Since this header is an opt-in security enhancement with permanent consequences we don't include it as a default feature but use the `allPagesHeaders` to include it.

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-gatsby-cloud`,
      options: {
        allPageHeaders: [
          "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload",
        ],
      }
    },
  ]
}
```
