# gatsby-source-graphql example with GraphCMS

Simple gatsby site that displays blog with data inside GraphCMS.

Built using [gatsby-source-graphql](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-graphql/).

<!-- [See it here](https://using-gatsby-source-graphql.netlify.app/) -->

## How it works

Using `gatsby-source-graphql`, this stitches schema from GraphCMS into Gatsby schema. All blog posts are retrieved in `gatsby-node` and pages are created for them.
