// This file is used to hold ambient type declarations, as well as type shims
// for npm module without type declarations, and assets files.

// For example, to shim modules without declarations, use:
// declare module "package-without-declarations"

// And to shim assets, use (one file extension per `declare`):
// declare module "*.png"
