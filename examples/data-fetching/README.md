  Gatsby data fetching
</h1>

This repository has examples for fetching data at build time or at runtime. Static data can be fed into components after being gathered up during a `gatsby build` and dynamic data can be fetched when the page loads in the browser. Refer to [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/data-fetching](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/data-fetching)

Note: In order to get data from GitHub (like this example uses), you need to provide a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in your request.
