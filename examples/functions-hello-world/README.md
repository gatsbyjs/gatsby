This example shows off the simplest possible Function.

1.  **Start developing.**

    To get started clone this repo locally and run `npm install` to add all necessary packages.

    ```shell
    cd examples/functions-hello-world
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! You can use the UI on the index page to test the functions or directly access them at http://localhost:8000/api/hello-world

    Try editing the text in `src/api/hello-world.js` to e.g. `Hello Gatsby Functions` and then re-running `curl`.

3.  **Deploy**

You can deploy this example on Gatsby Cloud by copying the example into a new repo and [connecting that to Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-gatsby-cloud/#set-up-an-existing-gatsby-site).
