# Linking Between Pages Recipe

This example walks through linking between pages in a Gatsby site using Gatsby Link.

Docs recipe: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/recipes/pages-layouts#linking-between-pages

## Install example

Set up the project by installing dependencies in the directory:

```
cd recipe-linking-between-pages
npm install
```

## Start the project

```
gatsby develop
```

## Run tests

Run the Cypress integration tests to make sure everything still works.

```
npm test
```

This will start the Cypress app to inspect tests in more detail. You can also run them in a single-run for Continuous Integration (e.g. on a GitHub PR):

```
npm run test:ci
```
