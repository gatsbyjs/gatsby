# Using WordPress

This is an example which contains sample code for demonstrating how to source data from Wordpress using the [gatsby-source-wordpress plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/). This example is not a starter or working site. It is meant for the purpose of learning and contains code that cannot be included in the recipe itself. This example is created to serve as an extension to the example code provided in the Sourcing from Wordpress recipe in the Sourcing data section.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This example site won't keep working if you switch the WordPress site to one of yours. It's meant as a learning resource. Try starting from scratch with a site created by `gatsby new` and start copying over parts from this site starting with `gatsby-config.js`.
