# using-mdx

This repository demonstrates how to add MDX pages to a new Gatsby site.

In the pages directory of this example you will find the `chart-info.mdx` file which uses a variety of components to display interactive charts.

## 🔧 Running locally

The site can be run locally on your own computer as well by following these steps:

1.  Clone the `gatsby` repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby.git
```

2.  Navigate to the example

```shell
cd gatsby/examples/using-mdx
```

3.  Install the dependencies for the application by running

```shell

npm install

```

4.  Run the Gatsby development server

```shell
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`, you can see the MDX example page at `http://localhost:8000/chart-info`
