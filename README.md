Gatsby helps professional developers efficiently create maintainable, highly-performant, content-rich websites.

- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

- **Go Beyond Static Websites.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Choose your Rendering Options.** You can choose alternative [rendering options](https://gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/rendering-options/), namely Deferred Static Generation (DSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), in addition to Static Site Generation (SSG) — on a per-page basis. This type of granular control allows you to optimize for performance and productivity without sacrificing one for the other.

- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources, and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

- **Use a Modern Stack for Every Site.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of whether the data is coming from the same backend.

- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don’t require servers, so you can host your entire site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be hosted entirely free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and other similar services.

- **Use Gatsby's Centralized Data Layer Everywhere.** With Gatsby's [Valhalla Content Hub](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/valhalla-content-hub/) you can bring Gatsby's data layer to any project. Making it accessible via a unified GraphQL API for building content sites, eCommerce platforms, and both native and web applications.

## 🚀 Ship your first Gatsby site in 5 Minutes

Click the link below to quickly try the workflow of developing, building, and deploying websites with Gatsby and Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog&utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=onboarding&utm_content=oss)

At the end of this process, you'll have

1. a site working on Netlify
2. a new repository that is linked to that new site
3. as you push changes to your new repository, Netlify will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site!

## 💻 Get started with Gatsby locally in 5 Minutes

You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

1. **Initialize a new project.**

   ```shell
   npm init gatsby
   ```

   Give it the name "My Gatsby Site".

2. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

   ```shell
   cd my-gatsby-site/
   npm run develop
   ```

3. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `my-gatsby-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/).
